# Eularian Fluid Simulation

This project implements an Eularian fluid simulation. The goal is to simulate fluid dynamics using a grid-based (Eularian) approach, allowing for visualization and experimentation with fluid behavior.

> **Status:** Work in progress

## Features

- Grid-based fluid simulation (Eularian method)
- Modular code structure for easy extension
- Visualization tools (planned)

## Getting Started

2. Install dependencies (requires `pygame`):
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3. Run the main simulation script.

_Detailed instructions will be added as development progresses._

## Roadmap

- [x] Litteral implementation in 2D of [Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)
- [] Refactor the code to improve efficiency / optmize still in python
- [] Write in C++ a code to do the same thing
- [] Implement an academic paper about Eularian Fluid Simulation

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by:

- Jos Stam's "Stable Fluids" ([SIGGRAPH 1999 paper](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf))
- Mike Ash's [Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)
